Common library used by other HG Tools.

## Installation

You have to manually add following dependencies:

- Add package from git URL `https://github.com/neuecc/UniRx.git?path=Assets/Plugins/UniRx/Scripts`
- Add package by name: `com.unity.test-framework.performance`. Since Unity doesn't allow experimental dependencies, you have to install it manually.
